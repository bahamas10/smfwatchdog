.SH "Synopsis"
SMF manages services on Illumos \fIhttp://illumos\.org\fR based operating systems\. It ensures that services, which may consist of 0 to many processes, are up and running, and handles any failures they may encounter\.
.
.P
The one thing that SMF is lacking however, is the ability to do service level health checks\. SMF bases your services health on process health, checking things such as processes dying, or exiting abnormally, etc\. However, it may be the case that a process is up, has a pid and \fB/proc\fR structure, but has locked up, or is not behaving how it should be\. \fBsmfwatchdog\fR is meant to do health checks (in the form of scripts) on your services, and proactively kill or restart the service under failure conditions\.
.
.P
The health check daemon is meant to run as a separate instance for each service you would like to monitor\. For example, an instance of \fBsmfwatchdog\fR would be running under the \fBnginx\fR service, while a different instance of \fBsmfwatchdog\fR would be running under the \fBapache\fR service\. The watchdog instance would only be responsible for checking the service under which it is running\.
.
.P
You can learn more about SMF by reading smf(5) \fIhttp://illumos\.org/man/5/smf\fR\.

This is a fairly standard manifest generated with smfgen \fIhttps://github\.com/davepacheco/smfgen\fR\. The server code written in Node looks like this:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

var http = require(\'http\');

var host = \'localhost\';
var port = 8000;

http\.createServer(onrequest)\.listen(port, host, listening);

function listening() {
  console\.log(\'server started: http://%s:%d/\', host, port);
}

var i = 0;
function onrequest(req, res) {
  console\.log(\'new request\');
  if (++i < 5) res\.end();
}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This webserver has a bug however, on the 5th request and thereafter, all requests stall, and the server locks up\. SMF by itself won\'t be able to detect this problem, as the process is up and has a valid \fB/proc\fR structure\. This is where \fBsmfwatchdog\fR can be used to detect and mitigate this issue\.
.
.P
Modify the \fBexec\fR line in the manifest to look like this:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

< <exec_method type="method" name="start" exec="node /home/dave/daves\-service/server\.js &amp;" timeout_seconds="10" />
\-\-\-
> <exec_method type="method" name="start" exec="smfwatchdog &amp; node /home/dave/daves\-service/server\.js &amp;" timeout_seconds="10" />
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This instructs the service to start an instance of \fBsmfwatchdog\fR with the node process\.
.
.P
Now, reimport the manifest, and restart the service\. The watchdog will be running as part of the service, which you can verify with \fBsvcs(1M)\fR
.
.IP "" 4

The watchdog is running, however it has nothing to do, as it has nothing to check\. We now have to write a health check for the service, to ensure that the webserver is reachable without timing out\.
.
.P
The daemon has created a unique directory for scripts to be placed in \fB/opt/local/share/smf/smfwatchdog/application\-daves\-service:default\fR, you can find it by looking at the logs of the service\.
.
.IP "" 4

.nf

$ grep \'plugins directory:\' "$(svcs \-L daves\-service)" | tail \-1

.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Any scripts in this directory will be executed every 60 seconds, and if any of them return non\-zero, the service will be restarted, and optionally an email will be sent out alerting of the failed health check and the action taken (including the output generated by the script that failed)\.
.
.P
Since checks are just scripts, we can use any language that we\'d like, so let\'s keep it simple and use some bash\. We\'ll create a basic health check to ensure the service is responsive over HTTP\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

vim /opt/local/share/smf/smfwatchdog/application\-daves\-service\e:default/check\.sh


#!/usr/bin/env bash
CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT=28
timeout=20 # seconds

curl \-sSk \-m "$timeout" "http://localhost:8000"
if (( $? == $CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT )); then
        exit 1
else
        exit 0
fi
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

And ensure the file is executable with:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

chmod +x /opt/local/share/smf/smfwatchdog/application\-daves\-service\e:default/check\.sh
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If curl returns with code 28, that means 20 seconds have elapsed with no response from the service, and the check itself will return with exit code 1\. When \fBsmfwatchdog\fR sees that a health check has failed, it will restart the service with \fBsvcadm restart <fmri>\fR\.
.
.P
We can see this in the logfile
.

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBSMFWATCHDOG_DEBUG\fR: (int) If this is non\-zero, \fBsmfwatchdog\fR will produce debug output to the service\'s log file (\fBsvcs \-L <fmri>\fR)

\fBSMFWATCHDOG_SLEEP\fR: (int) The time, in seconds, to sleep between running health check scripts, defaults to 60

\fBSMFWATCHDOG_DISABLED\fR: If set, \fBsmfwatchdog\fR will exit cleanly upon starting
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBSMFWATCHDOG_EMAIL\fR: If set, this variable will be used as an email address to send alerts to when a service has failed a health check
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBSMFWATCHDOG_EMAIL_FROM\fR: This is the address from which the above email will be sent, defaults to \fBnoreply@<hostname>\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBSMFWATCHDOG_MAIL_PROG\fR: The mail program to use to send email on the system, it must accept binary email data over stdin, defaults to \fBmailx \-t\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBSMF_FMRI\fR: This shouldn\'t be manually set, it will be set automatically by SMF, and is used to tell the watchdog which service to monitor

.SH "Notes / Issues"
The watchdog isn\'t a solution to a problem; it doesn\'t fix bugs\. The health checks are meant to minimize the impact of bugs that exist that currently have not been fixed in a service\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
This software hasn\'t been fully tested, and may contain bugs\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Some other coures of action may be more appropriate than restarting the service, as this may fail if the watchdog doesn\'t run as root
