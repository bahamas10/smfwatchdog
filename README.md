Synopsis
--------

SMF manages services on [Illumos](http://illumos.org) based operating
systems. It ensures that services, which may consist of 0 to many
processes, are up and running, and handles any failures they may
encounter.

The one thing that SMF is lacking however, is the ability to do service level
health checks.  SMF bases your services health on process health, checking
things such as processes dying, or exiting abnormally, etc. However, it may be
the case that a process is up, has a pid and `/proc` structure, but has
locked up, or is not behaving how it should be.  `smfwatchdog` is meant
to do health checks (in the form of scripts) on your services, and proactively
kill or restart the service under failure conditions.

The health check daemon is meant to run as a separate instance for each
service you would like to monitor.  For example, an instance of `smfwatchdog`
would be running under the `nginx` service, while a different instance of
`smfwatchdog` would be running under the `apache` service.  The watchdog
instance would only be responsible for checking the service under which it
is running.

You can learn more about SMF by reading [smf(5)](http://illumos.org/man/5/smf).

Installation
------------

Clone this repo, compile the source code, and install

    git clone git://github.com/bahamas10/smfwatchdog.git
    cd smfwatchdog
    make
    [sudo] make install

This will install the `smfwatchdog` binary and the `smfwatchdog.1` manpage.

Example
-------

Imagine a service that is a single [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org) process acting
as a webserver with the given SMF manifest.

`daves-service.xml`

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE service_bundle SYSTEM "/usr/share/lib/xml/dtd/service_bundle.dtd.1">
<!--
Manifest automatically generated by smfgen.
-->
<service_bundle type="manifest" name="application-daves-service" >
	<service name="application/daves-service" type="service" version="1" >
		<create_default_instance enabled="true" />
		<dependency name="dep1" grouping="require_all" restart_on="error" type="service" >
			<service_fmri value="svc:/milestone/multi-user:default" />
		</dependency>
		<method_context>
			<method_environment>
				<envvar name='PATH' value='/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin'/>
			</method_environment>
		</method_context>
		<exec_method type="method" name="start" exec="node /home/dave/daves-service/server.js &amp;" timeout_seconds="10" />
		<exec_method type="method" name="stop" exec=":kill" timeout_seconds="30" />
		<template >
			<common_name >
				<loctext xml:lang="C" >Dave's Service</loctext>
			</common_name>
		</template>
	</service>
</service_bundle>
```

This is a fairly standard manifest generated with [smfgen](https://github.com/davepacheco/smfgen).
The server code written in Node looks like this:

``` js
var http = require('http');

var host = 'localhost';
var port = 8000;

http.createServer(onrequest).listen(port, host, listening);

function listening() {
  console.log('server started: http://%s:%d/', host, port);
}

var i = 0;
function onrequest(req, res) {
  console.log('new request');
  if (++i < 5) res.end();
}
```

This webserver has a bug however, on the 5th request and thereafter, all
requests stall, and the server locks up.  SMF by itself won't be able to detect
this problem, as the process is up and has a valid `/proc` structure.
This is where `smfwatchdog` can be used to detect and mitigate this issue.

Modify the `exec` line in the manifest to look like this:

``` diff
< <exec_method type="method" name="start" exec="node /home/dave/daves-service/server.js &amp;" timeout_seconds="10" />
---
> <exec_method type="method" name="start" exec="smfwatchdog &amp; node /home/dave/daves-service/server.js &amp;" timeout_seconds="10" />
```

This instructs the service to start an instance of `smfwatchdog` with the node
process.

Now, reimport the manifest, and restart the service.  The watchdog will be
running as part of the service, which you can verify with `svcs(1M)`

    $ svcs -p daves-service
    STATE          STIME    FMRI
    online         10:51:43 svc:/application/daves-service:default
                   10:51:43    32188 smfwatchdog
                   10:51:43    32189 node

The watchdog is running, however it has nothing to do, as it has nothing to check.
We now have to write a health check for the service, to ensure that the webserver is
reachable without timing out.

The daemon has created a unique directory for scripts to be placed in
`/opt/local/share/smf/smfwatchdog/application-daves-service:default`, you
can find it by looking at the logs of the service.

    $ grep 'plugins directory:' "$(svcs -L daves-service)" | tail -1
    [smfwatchdog@0.0.0] [2013-06-12T17:51:43.081Z] plugins directory: /opt/local/share/smf/smfwatchdog/application-daves-service:default

Any scripts in this directory will be executed every 60 seconds, and if any
of them return non-zero, the service will be restarted, and optionally an
email will be sent out alerting of the failed health check and the action
taken (including the output generated by the script that failed).

Since checks are just scripts, we can use any language that we'd like, so let's
keep it simple and use some bash.  We'll create a basic health check to ensure
the service is responsive over HTTP.

    vim /opt/local/share/smf/smfwatchdog/application-daves-service\:default/check.sh

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT=28
timeout=20 # seconds

curl -sSk -m "$timeout" "http://localhost:8000"
if (( $? == $CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT )); then
        exit 1
else
        exit 0
fi
```

And ensure the file is executable with:

    chmod +x /opt/local/share/smf/smfwatchdog/application-daves-service\:default/check.sh

If curl returns with code 28, that means 20 seconds have elapsed with no response from the
service, and the check itself will return with exit code 1.  When `smfwatchdog` sees
that a health check has failed, it will restart the service with `svcadm restart <fmri>`.

We can see this in the logfile

    tail "$(svcs -L daves-service)"
    [ Jun 12 17:51:43 Executing start method ("smfwatchdog & node /home/dave/daves-service/server.js &"). ]
    [smfwatchdog@0.0.0] [2013-06-12T17:51:43.080Z] SMF_FMRI=svc:/application/daves-service:default
    [smfwatchdog@0.0.0] [2013-06-12T17:51:43.081Z] plugins directory: /opt/local/share/smf/smfwatchdog/application-daves-service:default
    [ Jun 12 17:51:43 Method "start" exited with status 0. ]
    server started: http://localhost:8000/
    new request
    new request
    new request
    new request
    new request
    [smfwatchdog@0.0.0] [2013-06-12T17:57:03.612Z] check.sh failed (exit code 1)
    [smfwatchdog@0.0.0] [2013-06-12T17:57:03.646Z] executing: svcadm restart svc:/application/daves-service:default
    [ Jun 12 17:57:03 Stopping because service restarting. ]
    [ Jun 12 17:57:03 Executing stop method (:kill). ]

Also, we can set an email address to alert by setting the environmental variable in the manifest.

``` xml
<envvar name='SMFWATCHDOG_EMAIL' value='dave@daveeddy.com'/>
```

Now, when a health check fails it'll fire an email which looks like:

    To: dave@daveeddy.com
    From: noreply@dave-01.local
    Subject: [smfwatchdog] daves-service:default failed healthcheck on dave-01.local

    daves-service:default restarted on dave-01.local

    FMRI: svc:/application/daves-service:default
    Hostname: dave-01.local
    Time (UTC): 2013-06-12T04:38:13
    Command: check.sh
    Program: smfwatchdog@0.0.0 (compiled Jun 11 2013 21:32:47)

    Command Output:
    curl: (28) Operation timed out after 20000 milliseconds with 0 bytes received

<a name="options" />

Options
-------

The following options can be passed in as environmental variables, most likely being
added to the SMF manifest.

- `SMFWATCHDOG_DEBUG`: (int) If this is non-zero, `smfwatchdog` will produce
    debug output to the service's log file (`svcs -L <fmri>`)
- `SMFWATCHDOG_SLEEP`: (int) The time, in seconds, to sleep between running
    health check scripts, defaults to 60
- `SMFWATCHDOG_DISABLED`: If set, `smfwatchdog` will exit cleanly upon starting
- `SMFWATCHDOG_EMAIL`: If set, this variable will be used as an email address
    to send alerts to when a service has failed a health check
- `SMFWATCHDOG_EMAIL_FROM`: This is the address from which the above email
    will be sent, defaults to `noreply@<hostname>`
- `SMFWATCHDOG_MAIL_PROG`: The mail program to use to send email on the system,
    it must accept binary email data over stdin, defaults to `mailx -t`
- `SMF_FMRI`: This shouldn't be manually set, it will be set automatically by
    SMF, and is used to tell the watchdog which service to monitor

Notes / Issues
--------------

The watchdog isn't a solution to a problem; it doesn't fix bugs. The health
checks are meant to minimize the impact of bugs that exist that currently have
not been fixed in a service.

- This software hasn't been fully tested, and may contain bugs.
- Some other course of action may be more appropriate than restarting the service,
as this may fail if the watchdog daemon doesn't run as root
